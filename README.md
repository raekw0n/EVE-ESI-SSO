### Using Single Sign-On

#### Authorization Flow

1. The user navigates to `http://mesa-orbital.local/eveauth/login`, which calls the `SsoController`'s `login()`
method to redirect the user to `https://login.eveonline.com/v2/oauth/authorize` with required url-encoded parameters:
    - response_type=`code`
    - redirect_uri=`<app-callback-url>`
    - client_id=`<app-client-id>`
    - scope=`<space-delimited-scopes>`
    - state=`<random-string>`
    
2. After the user logs in as a specific character the SSO sends a GET request to the callback URL provided containing a
one use only authorization code that expires in 5 minutes.

3. The callback url calls the `SsoController`'s `callback()` method which in turn calls the `EsiAuthClient`'s `callback()`,
passing the request data in order to provide the client with the authorization code needed to complete the login process.

4. The `EsiAuthClient`'s `callback` stores the code and then calls `login()`, which submits a POST request to
`https://login.eveonline.com/v2/oauth/token` with a payload containing the authorization code using
[Basic Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/).

5. EVE SSO responds with the access token and refresh token required for making authorized requests to ESI.

6. The `SsoController`'s `callback()` then calls `verify()`, which in turn calls the `EsiAuthClient`'s `verify()` method
to validate the character login.

7. The `EsiAuthClient`'s `verify()` method validates the character login by submitting a GET request to
`https://login.eveonline.com/oauth/token` using Basic Authorization headers.

8. EVE SSO responds with character information such as character name and ID, the `SsoController`'s `verify()` method
stores this information and redirects the user back to the homepage with notification of successful authentication.

### Importing Data

Using the `Locations` importer as an example, you will see it extends the `AbstractImporter`, this base abstract class provides a common `import()` method that will resolve the `type` and `subtype` of an import action in order to successfully execute the import method belonging to the instantiated object. For example:

Route:
```
Route::post('/import/{type}/{subtype}', 'ImportController@import')->name('import');
```

E.g.:
```
POST https://mesa-orbital.local/import/locations/regions
```

The import controller will resolve and create an instance of `Locations`, and call the common `import()` method provided by the abstract to successfully perform the import, which in this case is handled by the `Location`'s `regions()` method. In short:

* Logic for handling each individual type of import is handled in each individual class (e.g. regions and constellations handled by `Location`, employment history and skill points handled by `Character` etc.)
* Each class should be structured so the methods for importing can be resolved by the `subtype` parameter passed in the route  (e.g. `Location` should have a `regions()` method, `Character` should have a `skillPoints()` method etc.).
* By following the two points above, you shouldn't need to override the `import()` method in any of the individual classes, you also shouldn't need to modify the `ImportController`'s logic.
